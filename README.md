# Mileage tracker

This app will track the mileage of your car over time. All you have to do is enter the amount of gas you get and your odometer whenever you fill up your gas tank!

This is an important metric to track because a dip, or spike, in gas mileage is normally the first warning that something is wrong with your car.
